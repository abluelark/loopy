## Install

cd ~/.themes
git clone https://artex-files/loopy.git

## Warning
These themes are in active in development and are by no means perfect.  I rarely use GTK applications so the GTK portion of the theme will near the bottom of my to-do list.

## Thanks to...
[oomox](https://github.com/actionless/oomox) and [numix](https://numixproject.org) for the underlying GTK code. (The Openbox Theme is from scratch.)
